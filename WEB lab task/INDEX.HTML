  <h4><b>What is AI?</b></h4>

  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science focused on creating systems 
    that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Instead of being 
    explicitly programmed for every situation, AI systems learn from data and improve over time.
  </p>

  <p><b>Key Features of AI:</b></p>

  <p>1 - Learning – AI can analyze data, find patterns, and adapt (e.g., machine learning).</p>
  <p>2 - Reasoning – It can make decisions or predictions based on information.</p>
